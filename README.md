# RoboRock Vacuum Ballet Project ðŸ•ºðŸ¤–

Learn-by-doing control of a Roborock **S4 Max** using Python. This repo stays on the _easy, no-disassembly_ path:

- Uses the `python-roborock` SDK with your Roborock app credentials.
- Sends simple **goâ€‘to** waypoints to choreograph circles, squares, figureâ€‘eights, and Lissajous patterns.
- Includes a tiny CLI: `vacuum-ballet` for beeps, status, cleaning and docking.

> Safety first: test in a clear 2Ã—2 m area, start with small radii, and keep people/pets away.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) Sync dependencies (creates a .venv)
uv sync

# 2) Copy .env.example to .env and set values (credentials + controls)
# See .env.example for all variables

# 3) See devices on your account (S4 Max is model roborock.vacuum.a19)
uv run vacuum-ballet devices

# 4) Check status and battery
uv run vacuum-ballet status

# 5) Start cleaning
uv run vacuum-ballet clean

# 6) Return to dock
uv run vacuum-ballet dock

# 7) Tiny motion (adjust x/y to a near point on your map, units: millimetres)
uv run vacuum-ballet goto 32500 27500

# 8) Dance! (pattern radius_mm beat_ms)
#    The routine centres on the dock if map data is available.
uv run vacuum-ballet dance figure8 100 600

More dances:

uv run vacuum-ballet dance circle 400 1000
uv run vacuum-ballet dance square 200 600
uv run vacuum-ballet dance figure8 100 600
uv run vacuum-ballet dance spin_crazy 100 600


# 10) Map snapshots
# One shot:
uv run vacuum-ballet mapsnap
# Watch (interval seconds, count):
uv run vacuum-ballet mapwatch 2 30
uv run vacuum-ballet dance square 100 600

# 9) Run tests
uv run pytest
```

## What you'll learn

- Differential-drive motion by **waypoints**
- Basic timing & beats (BPM)
- Simple Python robotics programming
- All in one clean, readable file!
